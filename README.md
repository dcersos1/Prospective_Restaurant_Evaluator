# Prospective_Restaurant_Evaluator
Dan Cersosimo | Data Scientist | Random Forest Regression

**Summary**

• Processed a Yelp dataset to identify restaurants of specific criteria while conducting necessary feature engineering 
• Utilized Random Forest Regression to train a model of binary input features to predict a continuous target value, star rating
• Harnessed this model to construct a tool that predicts a star rating for a restaurant based on user-specified supplemental attributes
• Configured a geospatial visualization to portray the restaurants including the one designed by the client

**How to Run:**

In order to run, Jupyter Notebook must be installed alongside the necessary libraries as seen in the .ipynb file. The project is housed in the Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
